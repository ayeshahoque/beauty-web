            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to our about page, where we delve deeper into the world of skincare and explore what it takes to achieve 
                and maintain healthy, glowing skin. Skincare isn't just about vanity; it's a crucial aspect of self-care that impacts 
                both our physical and mental well-being. Understanding the needs of your skin and establishing a consistent skincare 
                routine tailored to those needs is essential for achieving the complexion you desire.
            </p>

                To achieve optimal skin health, it's important to incorporate key skincare products into your daily regimen. 
                Cleansers are the foundation of any skincare routine, effectively removing dirt, oil, and impurities from the skin's surface. 
                Toners help balance the skin's pH levels and tighten pores, preparing it for further treatment. Serums are concentrated 
                formulations packed with active ingredients that target specific skin concerns, such as hydration, brightening, or anti-aging. 
                Essence is a lightweight, hydrating product that penetrates deeply into the skin, providing nourishment and promoting cell renewal. 
                Moisturizers lock in moisture and create a protective barrier, keeping the skin hydrated and supple. Finally, sunscreen is 
                your skin's best defense against harmful UV rays, preventing sun damage, premature aging, and reducing the risk of skin cancer.
